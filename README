How to install?

For now, there is no packaged version so you must:

    clone the hg repo.
    install panda3d package
    install pyQT4
    go into the directory and start ppython main.py 

Details about usage

For now it has quite no GUI so in order to perform many operations you need to use keyboard hotkeys.

An other thing to be noticed is that all your models should be put into dataset folder with valid textures path etc...

Last for now, if your models are completely white it's normal. In order to see them coloured you should add a PointLight (by pressing L + P which stands for Lighting -> PointLight)
